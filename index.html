            <h2>Effects of Drought and Disasters</h2>
            <p>
              Droughts and disasters in Ethiopia have several devastating effects, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Food Insecurity: Droughts can lead to crop failures, causing food shortages and malnutrition.</li>
              <li>Water Scarcity: Reduced rainfall can lead to water scarcity, affecting both drinking water and
                agriculture.</li>
              <li>Environmental Degradation: Natural disasters can lead to soil erosion, deforestation, and habitat
                destruction.</li>
